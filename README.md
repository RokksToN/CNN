## CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks
The model is trained on MNIST dataset which consists of handwritten digits. The main goal of this model is to display my new skills related to Neural Networks and Computer Vision. While ago I made a program that does object detection on digital images in a more traditional way. This is an example how the same problem can be solved using different methods and approach.

A neural network with **99.3% accuracy** is impressive for something that can be coded in 30 minutes and has relatively few lines of code.
